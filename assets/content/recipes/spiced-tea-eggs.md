instructions:
  - Place eggs in a pot and fill with cold water to cover the eggs.
  - Cover pot and heat on high util water comes to a full rolling boil.
  - Open lid slightly, turn down heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
  - "Use the flat side of a knife to crush the red cardamom. Put the spices and
    2 cups of water in a 2 qt pot. If using Sous Vide, put the water and spices
    into a cooking pouch and skip the rest of this step. Cover and heat on high
    until boiling and then simmer until the eggs are peeled.  Note: Use the
    smallest pot that you can and don't add more water than you need to keep the
    eggs covered during the steeping process.  The more concentrated the
    poaching liquid, the better the taste.  If you are cooking a large batch
    just add more spices in the same ratio and you can make enough for a feast!"
  - Shock eggs in an ice-water bath and peel (work under the water in the bowl
    to make it easier to peel).
  - 'Add the light and dark soy sauce, shoaxing wine and eggs to the spiced
    water.  Add just enough water to cover. Simmer for a minimum of 4-24 hours.
    If using Sous Vide cook at 135 degrees for 4-24 hours.  Note: While they are
    delicious at 4 hours, the flavor is just starting to develop.  I always
    leave them the full 24 hours. All but one that comes out at about 18 hours
    because the smell is amazing and I cant wait.'
  - They store in the refrigerator for several days.  I tend to prefer the
    flavor best at room temperature or a little warmer and they go great with
    just about anything you put them with.  Try them on top of Sesame Noodles or
    floating in a bowl of Hot and Sour Soup.
